The code of my computer science bachelor thesis 2019/2020.

This is about the Eurovision Song Contest.

File 1: MFCCFromMP3Files.ipynb
File 2: MfccToSegments.ipynb
File 3: MusicExtractionFromSegments.ipynb
File 4: OrdinalRegressionModel.ipynb

Packages and software needed:
numpy
sklearn
h2o
xldr
json
fileinput
matplotlib
pandas


Example included in example directory. Consists of 1 mp3 file of the performance of the Netherlands in 2019.

Because the music extraction can take a very long time, the resulting files are included in the root directory. When using this, please remeber to adjust the directory path in the OrdinalRegressionModel.ipynb file. (This file is initialized to this repository)

When all the songs for the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest have been announced, I'll try to add those to this repository.

(Please, when using this, make sure the country names mentioned in the mp3 filenames are the same as the country names in the tables in the table directory.)
